# INSTRUCTIONS !
# This provided, working code calculates phi coefficients for each code line.
# Make sure that you understand how this works, then modify the traceit 
# function to work for function calls instead of lines. It should save the 
# function name and the return value of the function for each function call. 
# Use the mystery function that can be found at line 155 and the
# test cases at line 180 for this exercise.
# Modify the provided functions to use this information to calculate
# phi values for the function calls as described in the video.
# You should get 3 phi values for each function - one for positive values (1),
# one for 0 values and one for negative values (-1), called "bins" in the video.
# When you have found out which function call and which return value type (bin)
# correlates the most with failure, fill in the following 3 variables,
# Do NOT set these values dynamically.

answer_function = "X"   # One of f1, f2, f3
answer_bin = 42         # One of 1, 0, -1
