# INSTRUCTIONS
# Your task for this assignment is to combine the principles that you learned 
# in unit 3, 4 and 5 and create a fully automated program that can display
# the cause-effect chain automatically.
# In problem set 4 you created a program that generated cause chain
# if you provided it the locations (line and iteration number) to look at.
# That is not very useful. If you know the lines to look for changes, you
# already know a lot about the cause. Instead now, with the help of concepts
# introduced in unit 5 (line coverage), improve this program to create
# the locations list automatically, and then use it to print out only the
# failure inducing lines, as before.
# See some hints at the provided functions, and an example output at the end.
