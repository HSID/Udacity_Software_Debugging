# The provided code calculates phi coefficients for each code line.
# Make sure that you understand how this works, then modify the provided code
# to work also on function calls (you can use your code from problem set 5 here)
# Use the mystery function that can be found at line 170 and the
# test cases at line 165 for this exercise.
# Remember that for functions the phi values have to be calculated as
# described in the problem set 5 video - 
# you should get 3 phi values for each function - one for positive values (1),
# one for 0 values and one for negative values (-1), called "bins" in the video.
#
# Then combine both approaches to find out the function call and its return
# value that is the most correlated with failure, and then - the line in the
# function. Calculate phi values for the function and the line and put them
# in the variables below. 
# Do NOT set these values dynamically.

answer_function_phi = 42.0000    # precision to 4 decimal places.
answer_line_phi = 42.0000 # precision to 4 decimal places.
# if there are several lines with the same phi value, put them in a list,
# no leading whitespace is required
